# LaTeX Lab report template
This is a lab report template which I have made and have slowly been developing to suit my workflow. I have put this template on here so anyone who is interested in using it can easily clone this repo

```git clone https://github.com/LakeeSiv/       LaTeXLabReport.git```

and start using the template.

This template at first seems to be mainly sutied to students at the Univeristy of Cambridge (as the title page contains info about CRSid), however chaning a few lines on `utils\utils.tex` will allow you to change the title page info.


# Structure

`main.tex` is the main file you write your report on.

`utils\utils.tex` contains package imports and custom commands that I have created.

`utils\desc.txt` contains small descriptions on the custom commands that I have created.

>Note: the documentation for this template  is not the best
# Examples

There are example lab reports that I have created with their respective `.tex` files.
